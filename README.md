# **IMY 320 Phase 1**

## **Proposal and Concept**

**u14016304 u17246840 u18019499 u15210822**

The Website will be focused around 3 main windows/pages that the user will be able to interact with. This design was chosen to facilitate the easy exploration of the website without being lost in the &quot;clutter&quot; that most websites have nowadays. This also helps the user familiarize themselves with the website in a very short time. This lets the user know exactly where to go and where to find what they are looking for after their first visit to the site.

The general theme of the website will use two main colours, namely black and gold. These colours were chosen because this colour combination is so elegant and beautiful, and the two shades are very different so the contrast between them is very strong. Also, because gold is such a strong colour, that is must be used in small amounts, it makes the combination very nicely balanced.

The first page the user will see is the introduction page or welcoming page.

The basic design will be based of the following rough draft:

![](RackMultipart20200828-4-zua8qf_html_3987c6a5ff99485.gif)The block with the line fill pattern represents a group picture of the members of the YMI team.

Upon loading the page. The image will fade onto screen greeting the user with the team from YMI. This was chosen because the YMI group hopes to build a community with a close relationship to their user base. By introducing the user first to the team it will give the user the idea of a sense of community, and not the idea that this website is just another company with a boring generic ideology.

After 2 seconds, the &quot;enter&quot; button will fade onto screen. The design of this was meant to influence the user in looking at the picture of the group since it is the only thing on the screen at this point. It will be the focus of the screen until they are introduced to something new. 2 seconds was chosen because we do not want the user to feel like they are being trapped. The idea of using a button to enter the actual main page of the site makes the website have more user interaction.

The button will be rounded with padding to give it a more visually appealing design as to the generic square buttons. The position of the button and colour/background of it will be chosen depending on the group picture used and how the button and picture interact. If the picture&#39;s colours clash or hide the button. The button will be below the picture and a gold and black pattern will be used as the colours. This is to follow with the general concept of the websites theme as well as the hints of gold will attract the user&#39;s eyes to the button. This enables them to know exactly what they need to do when they want to leave this page and continue navigating the website.

The above image shows an alternative background image to the website on the intro page

Once the user presses the enter button, they will be navigated to the main page which will act as the &quot;hub&quot; for the content of the website. The page will primarily be a faded image as a background which is one of the many images from a video that is featured on this content creation website from the YMI team. Each time the user goes to this page from the intro page or gets redirected back to this main page the image will be different image with a faded blur effect. This was decided as to not make the website static. It provides a visually appealing background image and since the image is blurred it does not take away from the central focus of this page, which is the 5 tabs which are used to select the category of content that the YMI team makes. The concept of the blurred image also stirs interest in the user as to what is happening in the picture and makes them want to click on the provided tabs to find the actual video that the image comes from.

When the page loads. The screen will begin with just the faded background image. Then one by one the tabs will fall onto screen with a smooth animation. This grasps the user&#39;s attention as well as brings focus to the next available options the user can navigate the website with. Each tab will be from one of the 5 content types. The tab will have the name of the category and the background of the tab will be a video or gif of a video from that content type. The video or gif will only play when the user&#39;s mouse is hovering over the tab. Another effect that will happen when the user&#39;s mouse is hovering over a tab will be the tab will increase in size. This responsive design brings focus to the tab the user is showing interest in. It will start playing a loop of a video to give the user an idea of what they will see when they click on the tab and navigate to the viewing page. An example of this idea can be seen on the website [bien-joue](https://bien-joue.ca/%20%20%20%20).

The block with the line fill pattern represents a blurred faded image.

Once the user has clicked on a tab they will be directed to the &quot;Viewing&quot; page. The page will have this general design.

The top section displays a rounded play button that pulses every 2 seconds to attract the user&#39;s attention. When the user clicks the button, the video on the section below will begin to play. This allows the user to control the viewing of the video and gives time to get a feel of the page before watching. To the left of the button is a title of the video. This design was inspired by [CITATION Bie20 \l 7177]

Below the video is an arrow button pointing downwards for navigating to the page below. The user can either use the arrow key or scroll to the following page. Having the button as an arrow tells the user that there is something below the video player as well. The button will have a mouse hover effect to show that it is clickable. This helps with user flow for navigating the website.

The first section of the new page has a description of the project as well as any relevant information pertaining to the represented video. Below this section is a horizontal list of other projects in the same category in tabs. The other projects are displayed by either a manual carrousel like list with arrows to guide the user between the projects or a scrollbar controlling a list of projects horizontally. Having the manual carousel enables the user to not miss any information (http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/). The second idea for the scrollbar is intended to mitigate any issues caused by the carousel. The list is a looped list than can either be scrolled through using the scrollbar on the page or the scrolling feature of the mouse.

This allows the user to browse between the other projects that are available for viewing. On the left-hand side of displayed projects is an arrow button pointing upwards to allow the user to jump to the start of the page. When the user selects a project, the view scrolls horizontally to a page the same as the previous page but now show&#39;s the currently selected project.
